# Mukozi

Mukozi is a platform that bridges the process of finding a maid (househelp).
Mukozi_Web is the web version of the Mukozi Software suite built by **Mukozi Co.**
In just a few clicks, you can get a maid straight to your door step.
We take the inconvinience out of the entire process so that you are at ease.
